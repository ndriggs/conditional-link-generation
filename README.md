# conditional-link-generation
This repo is dedicated to using various approaches to generate links conditioned on invariants (you give me some invariant values, I give you a link with those invariant values). A link is one or more knots linked together. A knot is a link with one component [\[1\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Link_(knot_theory)). Invariants are numerical, boolean, or polynomial values or "properties" associated with a knot/link that don't change with different equivalent knot diagrams (different 2D projections of the same knot/link). See [Veritasium's YouTube video](https://youtu.be/8DBhTXM_Br4?si=3nWlkOe6v9e9OonI) for a fun, accessible introduction to knot theory. 

This project was inspired by [\[2\]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.11293) where the authors generated molecules that optimized a certain chemical property using reinforcement learning.  

## Reinforcement Learning
### Hindsight Experience Replay
### Curiousity 
One technique in reinforcement learning is to use intrinsic rewards (rewards generated by the agent, not the environment) to help promote exploration. One type of intrinsic reward is curiousity, where the agent has an internal network that tries to predict the next state give the current state and action. The intrinsic reward is the error between the actual next state and the predicted one. The network helps to "store" information about what state-action pairs the agent has seen so there is greater intrinsic reward when the agent explores unseen states-action pairs. Since the dynamics of this environment are known, we adapt curiousity the same way as in [\[2\]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.11293) and have the network predict just the invariant values of the state, allowing the network to store information on what states have been visited. 

Extensive experiments were performed to select which architecture should be used for the curiousity network. Results can be seen in [src/link_generation/predicting_signature](https://github.com/ndriggs/link-generation/tree/main/src/link_generation/predicting_signature).
