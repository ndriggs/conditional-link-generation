# link-generation
This repo is dedicated to using various approaches to generate links conditioned on invariants (you give me some invariant values, I give you a link with those invariant values). A link is one or more knots linked together. A knot is a link with one component [\[1\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Link_(knot_theory)). Invariants are numerical, boolean, or polynomial values or "properties" associated with a knot/link that don't change with different equivalent knot diagrams (different 2D projections of the same knot/link). See [Veritasium's YouTube video](https://youtu.be/8DBhTXM_Br4?si=3nWlkOe6v9e9OonI) for a fun, accessible introduction to knot theory. 

This project was inspired by [\[2\]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.11293) where the authors generated molecules that optimized a certain chemical property using reinforcement learning.
